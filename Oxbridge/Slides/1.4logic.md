# Introduction

<Remark>

Mathematics needs a particular precision, and within each of these languages, most of mathematics, and all the mathematics that we shall do, is written in the language of sets, using statements and arguments that are based on the grammar and logic of the predicate calculus.

# Definition of a set

<Definition title="Set">

A **set** is a collection of elements, without regard to order. Elements in a set are only counted once. For example, if $\displaystyle a=2$, $\displaystyle b=c=1$, then $\displaystyle A=\{a, b, c\}$ has only two members. We write $\displaystyle x \in X$ if $\displaystyle x$ is a member of the set $\displaystyle X$.

**Note:** The elements of a set can be any stuff (numbers, names, functions, SETS!)

</Definition>

---

# Example 1

<Example>

In Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) set theory, the natural numbers are defined recursively by letting $\displaystyle 0=\{\}$ be the empty set and $\displaystyle n+1=n \cup\{n\}$ for each $\displaystyle n$. In this way $\displaystyle n=\{0,1, \ldots, n-1\}$ for each natural number $\displaystyle n$. This definition has the property that $\displaystyle n$ is a set with $\displaystyle n$ elements. The first few numbers defined this way are:

$$\displaystyle \begin{array}{ll}
0=\{\} & =\varnothing, \\
1=\{0\} & =\{\varnothing\} \\
2=\{0,1\} & =\{\varnothing,\{\varnothing\}\}, \\
3=\{0,1,2\} & =\{\varnothing,\{\varnothing\},\{\varnothing,\{\varnothing\}\}\} .
\end{array}$$

</Example>

# Russell's paradox

<Note type="warning">

Consider a set $\displaystyle A$, $\displaystyle A=\{x \mid x \notin x\}$, does $\displaystyle A\in A$?

If $\displaystyle A\in A$, it does not satisfy the definition: $\displaystyle A\notin A$

If $\displaystyle A\notin A$, it satisfies the definition: $\displaystyle A\in A$

</Note>

---

# ZF set theory

<Note type="tip">

In 1908, Zermelo introduced a system of axioms; these were modified in 1922 by Fraenkel and Skolem. The resulting system, known as the Zermelo–Fraenkel axiom system ZF, has stood the test of time, and it is the one that we shall describe and use.

The sets and the relation $\displaystyle \in$ are required to satisfy certain axioms, some of the axioms are as follows:

- The extension axiom
- The empty set axiom
- The pairing axiom
- The union axiom
- The power set axiom

</Note>

---

# The extension axiom

<Definition title="The extension axiom">

This states that two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. Thus the set with members 1,2 and 3 and the set with members $\displaystyle 1,3,2$ and $\displaystyle 1$ are the same; the order in which they are listed is unimportant, as is the fact that repetition can occur. Set theory is all about membership, and about nothing else.

If $\displaystyle a$ and $\displaystyle b$ are sets, and every member of $\displaystyle a$ is a member of $\displaystyle b$, then we say that $\displaystyle a$ is a subset of $\displaystyle b$, or that $\displaystyle b$ contains $\displaystyle a$, and write $\displaystyle a \subseteq b$ or $\displaystyle b \supseteq a$. Thus the extension axiom says that $\displaystyle a=b$ if and only if $\displaystyle a \subseteq b$ and $\displaystyle b \subseteq a$. If $\displaystyle a \subseteq b$ and $\displaystyle a \neq b$, we say that $\displaystyle a$ is a proper subset of $\displaystyle b$, or that $\displaystyle a$ is properly contained in $\displaystyle b$, and write $\displaystyle a \subset b$ or $\displaystyle b \supset a$.

</Definition>

---

# The empty set axiom

<Definition title="The empty set axiom">

This states that there is a set with no members. The extension axiom then implies that there is only one such set: we denote it by $\displaystyle \varnothing$ and call it the empty set. It also has a rather paradoxical nature, since it is a subset of every set $\displaystyle a$ (if not, there is a member $\displaystyle b$ of $\displaystyle \varnothing$ which is not in $\displaystyle a$; but $\displaystyle \varnothing$ has no members).

</Definition>

---

# The pairing axiom

<Definition title="The pairing axiom">

This says that if $a$ and $b$ are sets, then there exists a set whose members are $a$ and $b$. The extension axiom again says that there is only one such set: we denote it by $\{a, b\}$. Note that $\{a, b\} = \{b, a\}$: we have an unordered pair. We can take $a = b$: then the set $\{a, a\}$ has only one element $a$. We write this set as $\{a\}$ and call it a singleton set.

We can use the pairing axiom to define ordered pairs. If $a$ and $b$ are sets, the ordered pair $(a, b)$ is represented by the set containing two elements: the singleton set $\{a\}$ and the pair $\{a, b\}$. That is, $\big\{\,\{a\},\, \{a, b\}\,\big\}$

</Definition>

---

# Example 2

<Example>

Prove that if $\displaystyle (a, b)$ and $\displaystyle (c, d)$ are ordered pairs and $\displaystyle (a, b)=(c, d)$, then $\displaystyle a=c$ and $\displaystyle b=d$.

</Example>

---

# The union axiom

<Definition title="The union axiom">

This says that there is a set whose elements are exactly the sets which are members of members of $\displaystyle A$. We denote this set by $\displaystyle \cup_{a \in A} a$ (here $\displaystyle a$ is a variable, so we could as well write $\displaystyle \cup_{x \in A} x$) and call it the union of the members of $\displaystyle A$. The essential feature of this axiom is that the sets whose members make up the union must all be members of a single set; we cannot form the union of all sets since there is no set to which all sets belong. If $\displaystyle A$ and $\displaystyle B$ are sets, we can consider the set $\displaystyle \cup_{C \in\{A, B\}} C$. This is the set whose elements are either in $\displaystyle A$ or in $\displaystyle B$: we write this as $\displaystyle A \cup B$.

</Definition>

---

# The power set axiom

<Definition title="The power set axiom">

There is an essential difference between the statements $\displaystyle b \in A$ ($\displaystyle b$ is a member of $\displaystyle A$) and $\displaystyle b \subseteq A$ ($\displaystyle b$ is a subset of $\displaystyle A$). The power set axiom states that if $\displaystyle A$ is a set, then there exists a set, the power set $\displaystyle P(A)$ of $\displaystyle A$, whose elements are the subsets of $\displaystyle A$. Thus $\displaystyle b \in P(A)$ if and only if $\displaystyle b \subseteq A$. For example, the elements of $\displaystyle P(\{a, b\})$ are $\displaystyle \varnothing$, $\displaystyle \{a\}$, $\displaystyle \{b\}$ and $\displaystyle \{a, b\}$, and the ordered pair $\displaystyle (a, b)=\big \{\{a\},\{a, b\}\}$ is an element of $\displaystyle P(P(\{a, b\}))$.


</Definition>

# Set symbols

<Remark type="remember">

- $\displaystyle \varnothing$ empty set: contains no elements
- $\displaystyle \mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3, \cdots\}$ is the set of natural numbers
- $\displaystyle \mathbb{N}_0=\{0,1,2, \cdots\}$ is the set of natural numbers with 0
- $\displaystyle \mathbb{Z}=\{\cdots,-2,-1,0,1,2, \cdots\}$ is the set of integers
- $\displaystyle \mathbb{Q}=\left\{\frac{a}{b} ; a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, b \neq 0\right\}$ is the set of rational numbers
- $\displaystyle \mathbb{R}$ is the set of real numbers
- $\displaystyle \mathbb{C}$ is the set of complex numbers

</Remark>

---

# Set operations

<Remark type="remember">

- **intersection**: $\displaystyle A \cap B=\{x: x \in A$ and $\displaystyle x \in B\}$
- **union**: $\displaystyle A \cup B=\{x: x \in A$ or $\displaystyle x \in B\}$
- **complementary** (of $\displaystyle A$ in $\displaystyle C$): $\displaystyle \bar{A} \cup A=C$ and $\displaystyle \bar{A} \cap A=\varnothing$
- **set difference**: $\displaystyle A \backslash B=\{x: x \in A$ and $\displaystyle x \notin B\}$
- **symmetric difference**: $\displaystyle A \Delta B=\{x: x \in A$ xor $\displaystyle x \in B\}$ elements in exactly one of the two sets.
- **the order/cardinality of a set**: $\displaystyle |A|=$ the number of elements in a set (to be more specific, it is finite).

</Remark>

---

# Example 3

<Example>

Prove that $\displaystyle |P(A)|=2^{|A|}$

</Example>

---

# Solution to Example 3

<Answer>

**Proof:**

We want to find the number of subsets of a set $\displaystyle A$.

Consider: for each element $\displaystyle x \in A$. Then a subset can contain $\displaystyle x$ or not. And we have $\displaystyle |A|$ different $\displaystyle x$'s.

Thus, the total number of subsets is $\displaystyle 2^{|A|}$.

**Example:**
$$\displaystyle \begin{array}{ll}
A=\{1,2,3\} & P(A)=\{\varnothing,\{1\},\{2\},\{3\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{2,3\},\{1,2,3\}\} \\
|A|=3 & |P(A)|=8=2^3 .
\end{array}$$

</Answer>

# Example 4

<Example>

Prove the followings:

$(a)$ $\displaystyle \overline{A \cup B}=\bar{A} \cap \bar{B}$

$(b)$ $\displaystyle \overline{A \cap B}=\bar{A} \cup \bar{B}$

**Note:** Do not use the Venn Diagram to prove set relations

To prove these results, we need to be familiar with formal logic first.

</Example>

---

# Exercise 4

<ClassQuestion title="Exercise">

Use the Venn Diagram to visualize the following results:

$(a)$ $\displaystyle A\cup(B\cap C)=(A\cup B)\cap(A\cup C)$

$(b)$ $\displaystyle A\setminus(B\cap C)=(A\setminus B)\cap(A\setminus C)$

$(c)$ $\displaystyle A\Delta B=(A\cup B)\setminus(A\cap B)$

# Statement

<Definition title="Statement">

A **statement**, or a **proposition**, is a sentence which is either true or false, but not both.

We say that a statement can have a **truth value**.

**Examples of statements:**
- $\displaystyle 1 + 1 = 2$
- There are infinitely many primes of the form $\displaystyle n^2 + 1$.
- There is always a prime number between $\displaystyle n$ and $\displaystyle 2n$.
- Today is Friday.

**Examples of non-statements:**
- John is a smart guy.
- $\displaystyle x$ is a very large number.

</Definition>

---

# Negation

<Definition title="Negation">

Given a statement $\displaystyle p$, $\displaystyle \sim p$ or $\displaystyle \neg p$ (read as "not $\displaystyle p$") is the **negation** of the statement $\displaystyle p$.

For example, consider the statement $\displaystyle p$: "I have a headache."

The statement "I do not have a headache" is the negation of $\displaystyle p$.

**Note:** $\displaystyle p$ and $\displaystyle \neg p$ always have different truth values.

</Definition>

---

# Example 5

<Example title="Example 5">

Write down the negation of the following statements:

$(a)$ There are integers $\displaystyle x$ and $\displaystyle y$ such that $\displaystyle 2x + 3y = 0$.

$(b)$ If $\displaystyle x$ and $\displaystyle y$ are any odd integers, then $\displaystyle xy$ is an odd integer.

$(c)$ For all real values $\displaystyle x$, $\displaystyle x^2 > 0$ and $\displaystyle \sin x \leq 1$.

</Example>

---

# Quantifiers

<Definition title="Quantifiers">

- $\displaystyle \forall$ symbolizes "for all"
- $\displaystyle \exists$ symbolizes "there exists"

**Forms of quantified statements:**

1. $\displaystyle \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, x^2 \geq 0$
   - For any real number $\displaystyle x$, $\displaystyle x^2 \geq 0$.

2. $\displaystyle \exists x \in \mathbb{R}, x^2 = 2$
   - There exists a real number such that $\displaystyle x^2 = 2$.

</Definition>

---

# Negation with Quantifiers

<Example title="Example">

Consider the statement $\displaystyle p$: "The height of everyone in the room is at least 150cm."

- $\displaystyle p: \forall i \in \{\text{Alan, Beth, ..., Zach}\}, h_i \geq 150$
- $\displaystyle \neg p: \exists i \in \{\text{Alan, Beth, ..., Zach}\}, h_i < 150$

For $\displaystyle p$ to be true, every single person must be at least 150cm tall.
For $\displaystyle p$ to be false, it suffices for at least one person to be less than 150cm tall.

</Example>

---

# Negation with Quantifiers

<Note type="tip">

**Key rule for negating quantifiers:**

$$\displaystyle \neg(\forall x, p(x)) \equiv (\exists x, \neg p(x))$$

</Note>

---

# Exercise 5

<ClassQuestion title="Exercise 5">

Write the negation of the following statements:

1. $\displaystyle \exists x \in \mathbb{R}, -2 < x < 3$

2. $\displaystyle \forall x \in \mathbb{Z}$, if $\displaystyle x$ is odd, then $\displaystyle x^2$ is odd.

</ClassQuestion>

---

# Conditional Statements

<Definition title="Conditional Statement">

An important connective is the **conditional statement** $\displaystyle (p \Rightarrow q)$.

The conditional statement "$\displaystyle p$ implies $\displaystyle q$" ($\displaystyle p \Rightarrow q$) means that if $\displaystyle p$ is a true statement then $\displaystyle q$ is also a true statement.

**Key point:** $\displaystyle p \Rightarrow q$ fails to hold only when $\displaystyle p$ is true and $\displaystyle q$ is false!

If $\displaystyle p$ is false then the statement $\displaystyle p \Rightarrow q$ is said to be **vacuously true**.

</Definition>

---

# Ways to Express Conditional Statements

<Note type="tip">

There are several ways in which $\displaystyle p \Rightarrow q$ can be expressed in Mathematics:

- $\displaystyle p$ is the **hypothesis** of the conditional statement
- $\displaystyle q$ is the **conclusion**

**Equivalent expressions:**
1. "if $\displaystyle p$ then $\displaystyle q$"
2. "$\displaystyle p$ only if $\displaystyle q$"
3. "$\displaystyle p$ is a sufficient condition for $\displaystyle q$"
4. "$\displaystyle q$ is a necessary condition for $\displaystyle p$"

</Note>

# Contrapositive

<Definition title="Contrapositive">

$\displaystyle \neg B \Rightarrow \neg A$ is called the **contrapositive** of $\displaystyle A \Rightarrow B$.

**Important:** $\displaystyle A \Rightarrow B$ always has the same truth value as $\displaystyle \neg B \Rightarrow \neg A$.

More precisely, $\displaystyle A \Rightarrow B$ and $\displaystyle \neg B \Rightarrow \neg A$ are **equivalent statements**.

</Definition>

---

# Necessary and Sufficient Conditions

<Definition title="Biconditional">

"$\displaystyle p$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for $\displaystyle q$" means "$\displaystyle p$ if and only if $\displaystyle q$" ($\displaystyle p$ iff $\displaystyle q$) or symbolically, $\displaystyle p \Leftrightarrow q$.

From the contrapositive property:
$$\displaystyle (A \Rightarrow B) \Leftrightarrow (\neg B \Rightarrow \neg A)$$

</Definition>

# Negation of "P implies Q"

<Note type="tip">

**Key results:**

1. The negation of "$\displaystyle P$ implies $\displaystyle Q$" is "$\displaystyle P$ and not $\displaystyle Q$"

2. "$\displaystyle P$ implies $\displaystyle Q$" always has the same truth value as "not $\displaystyle P$ or $\displaystyle Q$"

**Proof:**
$$\displaystyle \begin{aligned}
\neg(P \Rightarrow Q) &= \neg(\neg P \vee Q) \\
&= P \wedge \neg Q

# Use of Counter Examples

<Definition title="Proof by Counter Example">

If a statement is suspected of being false, then one single **counter example** is sufficient to prove this fact.

</Definition>

---

# Example 12

<Example title="Example 12">

Determine if the following statements are true or false, justifying your answer:

$(a)$ If $\displaystyle f''(x) = 0$ when $\displaystyle x = a$, then $\displaystyle f(x)$ has a point of inflection when $\displaystyle x = a$.

</ClassQuestion>

# Mathematical Induction

<Definition title="Mathematical Induction">

A proof by **induction** consists of two cases:

1. **Base case:** Proves the statement for $\displaystyle n = 0$ (or $\displaystyle n = 1$, or some fixed $\displaystyle n = N$) without assuming any knowledge of other cases.

2. **Induction step:** Proves that if the statement holds for any given case $\displaystyle n = k$, then it must also hold for the next case $\displaystyle n = k + 1$.

These two steps establish that the statement holds for every natural number $\displaystyle n \geq N$.

</Definition>

---

# Strong Induction

<Definition title="Strong Induction">

**Strong induction** is similar to standard induction, but with a difference in the inductive hypothesis:

- **Standard induction:** Assume $\displaystyle P(k)$ is true to prove $\displaystyle P(k+1)$
- **Strong induction:** Assume all of $\displaystyle P(1), P(2), \ldots, P(k)$ are true to prove $\displaystyle P(k+1)$

</Definition>
