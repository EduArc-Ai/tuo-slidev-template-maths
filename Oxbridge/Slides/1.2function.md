# Quadratics

<Definition title="Quadratics">

In algebra, a quadratic equation is any equation that can be rearranged in standard form as

$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

where $x$ represents an unknown value, and $a$, $b$, and $c$ represent known numbers, where $a \neq 0$. (If $a = 0$ and $b \neq 0$ then the equation is linear, not quadratic)

</Definition>

---

# Quadratic formula

<Theorem title="Quadratic formula">

$$\displaystyle \begin{gather*}
ax^2 + bx + c = 0, \quad a \neq 0 \\
\Leftrightarrow x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x = -\frac{c}{a} \\
\Leftrightarrow x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = -\frac{c}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 \\
\Leftrightarrow \left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2} \\
\Leftrightarrow x + \frac{b}{2a} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\
\Leftrightarrow x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{gather*}$$

<Remark type="remember">

A quadratic equation with real coefficients can have either one or two distinct real roots, or two distinct complex roots. In this case the discriminant $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$ determines the number and nature of the roots. There are three cases:

- If the discriminant is positive, then there are two distinct roots
- If the discriminant is zero, then there is exactly one real root, sometimes called a repeated or double root or two equal roots
- If the discriminant is negative, then there are no real roots. Rather, there are two distinct (non-real) complex roots which are complex conjugates of each other.

# Example 1

<Example>

$$(*) \quad ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \quad a > 0$$

What is the necessary and sufficient condition for equation (*) to have at least one positive root?

</Example>

---

# Solution?

<Question title="Is this the correct solution">

Consider the following "solution"

Let $\displaystyle \alpha,\beta$ be the two roots of $(*)$

$\displaystyle \alpha+\beta=-\frac{b}{a}$

$\displaystyle \alpha\cdot\beta=\frac{c}{a}$

Wlog (without loss of generality), assume that $\displaystyle \alpha \leq \beta$. We just need $\displaystyle \beta>0$

$$\left\{\begin{array}{l}
(1) c<0 \\
(2) c>0, \quad b<0 .
\end{array}\right.$$

</Question>

---

# Solution

<Answer>

$$\displaystyle \begin{aligned}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \quad a&>0 \\
\sqrt{b^2-4ac}-b &> 0 \\ 
\sqrt{b^2-4ac} &> b
\end{aligned}$$

</Answer>

---

# Example 2

<Example>

Solve the following questions on quadratics:

$(a)$ $\sqrt{90 + \sqrt{90 + \sqrt{90 + \cdots}}}$

$(b)$ $\sqrt{61 - 28\sqrt{3}} =$

</Example>

---

# Polynomials

<Definition title="Polynomials">

A polynomial in a single variable $x$ can always be written (or rewritten) in the form

$$a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0$$

where $a_0, \ldots, a_n$ are constants that are called the coefficients of the polynomial.

This can be expressed more concisely by using summation notation:

$$\sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k$$

In mathematics, the degree of a polynomial is the highest of the degrees of the polynomial's monomials (individual terms) with non-zero coefficients. The degree of a term is the sum of the exponents of the variables that appear in it, and thus is a non-negative integer.

</Definition>

---

# Example 3

<Example>

Consider polynomial $P(x)$ with degree $m$ and polynomial $Q(x)$ with degree $n$. Find, in different cases, the degree of

$(1)$ $P(x) + Q(x)$

$(2)$ $P(x) - Q(x)$

$(3)$ $P(x)Q(x)$

$(4)$ $P(Q(x))$

</Example>

---

# Factorization

<Note type="tip">

In elementary algebra, factoring a polynomial reduces the problem of finding its roots to finding the roots of the factors.

For example, $P(x) = Q(x)R(x) = 0 \Leftrightarrow Q(x) = 0$ or $R(x) = 0$.

</Note>

---

# Polynomial identities

<Remark type="remember">

There are some identities we often use in factorization:

- $(x \pm y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 \pm 2xy$
- $a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)$
- $x^2 + (a + b)x + ab = (x + a)(x + b)$
- $x^3 \pm y^3 = (x + y)(x^2 + y^2 \mp xy)$
- $(x^n - y^n) = (x - y)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + \cdots + xy^{n-2} + y^{n-1})$
- $(x^n + y^n) = (x + y)(x^{n-1} - x^{n-2}y + \cdots - xy^{n-2} + y^{n-1})$ for odd $n$
- $(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2xy + 2xz + 2yz$

</Remark>

# Example 4

<Example>

Simplify $(1 - x + x^2)(1 - x^2 + x^4)(1 - x^4 + x^8) \cdots (1 - x^n + x^{2n})$

</Example>

# Exercise 4

<ClassQuestion title="Exercise">

$(a)$ Factorize $a^n + 1$ when $n$ is odd.

$(b)$ Let $a$ and $n$ be integers greater than 1. Suppose that $a^n - 1$ is prime. Show that $a = 2$ and $n$ is prime.

# Sophie Germain's identity

<Theorem title="Sophie Germain's identity">

In mathematics, Sophie Germain's identity is a polynomial factorization named after Sophie Germain stating that

$$\begin{aligned}
x^4 + 4y^4 &= ((x + y)^2 + y^2) \cdot ((x - y)^2 + y^2) \\
&= (x^2 + 2xy + 2y^2) \cdot (x^2 - 2xy + 2y^2).
\end{aligned}$$

</Theorem>

---

# Derivation

<Note>

$$\displaystyle \begin{aligned}
x^4 + y^4 &= (x^2 - y^2)^2 + 2(xy)^2 \\
&= (x^2 + y^2)^2 - 2(xy)^2.
\end{aligned}$$

Modifying this equation by multiplying $\displaystyle y$ by $\displaystyle \sqrt{2}$ gives

$$\displaystyle x^4 + 4y^4 = (x^2 + 2y^2)^2 - 4(xy)^2$$

</Note>

# Factor theorem and remainder theorem

<Theorem title="Factor theorem and remainder theorem">

**Factor theorem:** A polynomial $p(x)$ has a factor $(x - k)$ if and only if $p(k) = 0$.

**Remainder theorem:** A polynomial $p(x)$ divides $(x - k)$ has remainder $p(k)$.

Note: to prove the above theorems, consider $p(x) = (x - k)q(k) +$ remainder.

</Theorem>

# Rational root test

<Theorem title="Rational root test">

Let

$$a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 = 0$$

be an equation with integer coefficients $a_i \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $a_0, a_n \neq 0$. The theorem states that each rational solution $x = p/q$, written in lowest terms so that $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime, satisfies:

- $p$ is an integer factor of the constant term $a_0$, and
- $q$ is an integer factor of the leading coefficient $a_n$.

</Theorem>

# Example 8

<Example>

Use de Moivre's theorem to show that

$$\cos 4\theta = 8\cos^4 \theta - 8\cos^2 \theta + 1.$$

Without using a calculator, verify that $\cos 4\theta = -\cos 3\theta$ for each of the values $\theta = \frac{1}{7}\pi, \frac{3}{7}\pi, \frac{5}{7}\pi, \pi$.

Using the result $\cos 3\theta = 4\cos^3 \theta - 3\cos \theta$, show that the roots of the equation

$$8c^4 + 4c^3 - 8c^2 - 3c + 1 = 0$$

are $\cos \frac{1}{7}\pi, \cos \frac{3}{7}\pi, \cos \frac{5}{7}\pi, -1$

Hence prove that $\cos \frac{1}{7}\pi$ is irrational

# Fundamental theorem of algebra

# Corollary

<Theorem title="Corollary">

Let $p$ and $q$ be polynomials of degree at most $n$. If $p(z) = q(z)$ at $n + 1$ distinct points then $p(z) = q(z)$ for all $z$.

</Theorem>

# Vieta's formulas

<Theorem title="Vieta's formulas">

For any general polynomial of degree $n$

$$P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$$

Vieta's formulas relate the polynomial's coefficients to signed sums of products of the roots $r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n$ as follows:

$$\left\{\begin{array}{l}
r_1 + r_2 + \cdots + r_{n-1} + r_n = -\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} \\
(r_1 r_2 + r_1 r_3 + \cdots + r_1 r_n) + (r_2 r_3 + r_2 r_4 + \cdots + r_2 r_n) + \cdots + r_{n-1} r_n = \frac{a_{n-2}}{a_n} \\
\quad \vdots \\
r_1 r_2 \cdots r_n = (-1)^n \frac{a_0}{a_n}.

$$y^4 - 8y^3 + 12y^2 + 7y + 4 = 0$$

# Multinomial theorem

<Theorem title="Multinomial theorem">

For any positive integer $m$ and any non-negative integer $n$, the multinomial formula describes how a sum with $m$ terms expands when raised to an arbitrary power $n$:

$$(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_m)^n = \sum_{k_1 + k_2 + \cdots + k_m = n; k_1, k_2, \cdots, k_m \geq 0} \binom{n}{k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m} \prod_{t=1}^m x_t^{k_t}$$

$$\binom{n}{k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m} = \frac{n!}{k_1! k_2! \cdots k_m!}$$

is a multinomial coefficient.

# Functions

<Definition title="Functions">

Definition: A **function** (or map) $f: A \mapsto B$ is a 'rule' that assigns, for each $a \in A$, precisely one element $f(a) \in B$. We can write $a \mapsto f(a)$. $A$ and $B$ are called **domain** and **co-domain** respectively.

</Definition>

---

# Injective

<Definition title="Injective">

A function $f: X \mapsto Y$ is **injective** if it hits everything at most once.

$$(\forall x, y \in X) \quad f(x) = f(y) \Rightarrow x = y$$

</Definition>

---

# Surjective

<Definition title="Surjective">

A function $f: X \mapsto Y$ is **surjective** if it hits everything at least once.

$$(\forall y \in Y)(\exists x \in X) \quad f(x) = y$$

</Definition>

---

# Bijective

<Definition title="Bijective">

A function is **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective.

</Definition>

---

# Example 12

<Example>

Consider the function $f: \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) = x^2$.

Is $f(x)$ surjective? injective? bijective?

</Example>

---

# Exercise 12

<ClassQuestion title="Exercise">

Consider the function $f: \mathbb{R}^+ \mapsto \mathbb{R}^+$, $f(x) = x^2$.

Is $f(x)$ surjective? injective? bijective?

</ClassQuestion>

---

# Example 13

<Example>

Consider the (infinite) set $\mathbb{Z}$ of integers. Show that there is a function $f: \mathbb{Z} \mapsto \mathbb{Z}$ that is injective but not surjective, and a function $g: \mathbb{Z} \mapsto \mathbb{Z}$ that is surjective but not injective. Now let $X$ be any finite set, and let $f: X \mapsto X$ be any function. Show that the following statements are equivalent:

$(a)$ $f: X \mapsto X$ is injective;

$(b)$ $f: X \mapsto X$ is surjective;

$(c)$ $f: X \mapsto X$ is bijective.

</Example>

---

# Inverse function

<Theorem title="Inverse function">

We now discuss conditions under which a function $f: X \mapsto Y$ has an inverse function $f^{-1}: Y \mapsto X$ which 'reverses' the action of $f$. Explicitly, we want to find a function $g: Y \mapsto X$ such that for all $x$ in $X$, $g f(x) = x$ and for all $y$ in $Y$, $f g(y) = y$. These two conditions are equivalent to $g f = I_X$ and $f g = I_Y$.

A function $f: X \mapsto Y$ is invertible if and only if it is a bijection. If this is so then $f^{-1}: Y \mapsto X$ is also a bijection.

</Theorem>

---

# Monotonic functions

<Definition title="Monotonic functions">

A function is called **monotonically increasing** (also non-decreasing) if for all $x$ and $y$ such that $x \leq y$ one has $f(x) \leq f(y)$, so $f$ preserves the order. Likewise, a function is called **monotonically decreasing** (also non-increasing) if, whenever $x \leq y$, then $f(x) \geq f(y)$, so it reverses the order.

If the order $\leq$ in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order $<$, one obtains a stronger requirement. A function with this property is called **strictly increasing** (also increasing). Again, by inverting the order symbol, one finds a corresponding concept called **strictly decreasing** (also decreasing). A function with either property is called **strictly monotone**. Functions that are strictly monotone are one-to-one/bijective.

</Definition>

---

# Monotonic functions

<Note type="tip">

All strictly monotonic functions are invertible.

$f(x)$ is strictly monotonic $\Rightarrow$ $f^{-1}(x)$ exists

</Note>

---

# Example 14

<Example>

Show that the map $f: \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ defined by $\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ when $x \neq 0$, and $f(0) = 0$, is a bijection.

What is the inverse of this function?

<div style="flex: 1;">

<Definition title="Composite functions">

In mathematics, function composition is an operation $\circ$ that takes two functions $f$ and $g$, and produces a function $h = g \circ f$ such that $h(x) = g(f(x))$. In this operation, the function $g$ is applied to the result of applying the function $f$ to $x$ ($f$ first, followed by $g$). That is, the functions $f: X \mapsto Y$ and $g: Y \mapsto Z$ are composed to yield a function that maps $x$ in domain $X$ to $g(f(x))$ in codomain $Z$.

</Definition>

</div>

</div>

---

# Properties of composite functions

<Remark type="remember">

The composition of functions is always associative, that is, $h g f(x) = (h g) f(x) = h(g f)(x)$

The composition of functions is generally not commutative, that is, $g f(x) \neq f g(x)$

The composition of one-to-one (injective) functions is always one-to-one. Similarly, the composition of onto (surjective) functions is always onto. It follows that the composition of two bijections is also a bijection. The inverse function of a composition (assumed invertible) has the property that $(f \circ g)^{-1} = g^{-1} \circ f^{-1}$

</Remark>

# Example 15

<Example>

Let

$$f(x) = x + 1 \quad \text{and} \quad g(x) = 2x.$$

We will, for example, write $f g$ to denote the function "perform $g$ then perform $f$" so that

$$f g(x) = f(g(x)) = 2x + 1$$

If $i \geq 0$ is an integer we will, for example, write $f^i$ to denote the function which performs $f$ $i$ times, so that

$$f^i(x) = \underbrace{f f f \cdots f}_{i \text{ times}}(x) = x + i.$$

$(i)$ Show that

$$f^2 g(x) = g f(x)$$

$$g f^2 g(x) = 4x + 4$$

Find all the other ways of combining $f$ and $g$ that result in the function $4x + 4$.

$(iii)$ Let $i, j, k \geq 0$ be integers. Determine the function

$$f^i g f^j g f^k(x)$$

$(iv)$ Let $m \geq 0$ be an integer. How many different ways of combining the functions $f$ and $g$ are there that result in the function $4x + 4m$?

# Parity of a function

<Definition title="Parity">

A function $f(x)$ (given that its domain is symmetrical about 0) is

- **even** if $f(-x) = f(x)$
- **odd** if $f(-x) = -f(x)$

</Definition>

# Example 16

<Example>

What are some examples of odd and even functions?

In general, any polynomial function with only even powers of $x$ is an even function.

Any polynomial function with only odd powers of $x$ is an odd function.

# Curve transformations

<Note type="tip">

There are mainly two types of transformations: translation and stretching.

For translation,

$\displaystyle y = f(x) \stackrel{a \text{ to left}}{\longrightarrow} f(x + a)$

$\displaystyle y = f(x) \stackrel{a \text{ to right}}{\longrightarrow} f(x - a)$

$\displaystyle y = f(x) \stackrel{a \text{ upwards}}{\longrightarrow} f(x) + a$

$\displaystyle y = f(x) \stackrel{a \text{ downwards}}{\longrightarrow} f(x) - a$

</Note>

---

# Curve transformation

<Note type="tip">

For stretching,

$\displaystyle y = f(x) \stackrel{\text{factor a along x-axis}}{\longrightarrow} f\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)$

$\displaystyle y = f(x) \stackrel{\text{factor a along y-axis}}{\longrightarrow} \frac{f(x)}{a}$

</Note>

---

# Order

<Note type="tip">

When there are multiple transformations, apply the "AMMA" rule,

that is, apply 'addition/subtraction on x,' 'multiplication/division on x,' 'multiplication/division on y,' 'addition/subtraction on y' in this order.

</Note>

---

# Modulus

<Note type="tip">

$\displaystyle f(|x|) \longrightarrow$ flip what's on the right (of the y-axis) to the left

$\displaystyle |f(x)| \longrightarrow$ flip what's below (the x-axis) to above

</Note>
