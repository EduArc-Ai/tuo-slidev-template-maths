# 3.1 不等式(Inequality)

---

# Introduction

<Remark>

In general, inequalities are used to make comparisons, and to make estimations. It is one of two simple tools that form the language of estimations, the other being absolute values for measuring size and distance.

</Remark>

---

# Estimation

<Definition title="Estimation">

If $\displaystyle c$ is a number we are estimating, and $\displaystyle m < c < M$, we say that $\displaystyle m$ is a lower estimate (lower bound) for $\displaystyle c$ and $\displaystyle M$ is an upper estimate (upper bound) for $\displaystyle c$.

If two sets of upper and lower bounds satisfy the inequalities

$$m < m' < c < M' < M$$

we say that $\displaystyle m', M'$ are stronger or sharper estimates for $\displaystyle c$, while $\displaystyle m, M$ are weaker estimates.

</Definition>

---

# Example

<Example>

Give upper and lower bounds for $\displaystyle \frac{1}{a^4 + 3a^2 + 1}$.

</Example>

---

# Exercise

<ClassQuestion title="Exercise">

$(a)$ Give upper and lower estimates for $\displaystyle \frac{1 + \sin^2 n}{1 + \cos^2 n}$, for $\displaystyle n \geq 0$.

$(b)$ In Fourier Analysis, one uses trigonometric sums of the form

$$S_n = c_1 \cos t + c_2 \cos 2t + \ldots + c_n \cos nt$$

If $\displaystyle c_i = \frac{1}{2^i}$, give an upper bound for $\displaystyle S_n$.

</ClassQuestion>

---

# Absolute value

<Remark type="remember">

Two important and common uses of the absolute value are as follows:

$(1)$ $\displaystyle |a| \geq 0$ for all real values $\displaystyle a$.

$(2)$ $\displaystyle |a| \leq M \Leftrightarrow -M \leq a \leq M$. The absolute value is also an efficient way to give symmetric bounds. In fact, the inequality on the left is often more convenient to use. If the bounds are not symmetric to start with, they can be made so by doing the following:

$$K \leq a \leq L \Rightarrow |a| \leq M, \text{ where } M = \max(|K|, |L|).$$

In working with absolute values, we will make frequent use of the simple property $\displaystyle |ab| = |a||b|$ as well as the triangle inequality ($\displaystyle |a + b| \leq |a| + |b|$), a law that connects the absolute value with sums.

</Remark>

# Polynomial inequality

<Note type="tip">

**Step 1:** Rewrite the inequality so there is a zero on the right side of the inequality. The expression on the left side designate as $\displaystyle f(x)$.

**Step 2:** Find the critical numbers. Critical numbers for polynomial functions are the real number solutions to $\displaystyle f(x) = 0$. Draw a number line with the critical numbers labelled. Draw an open circle at each critical number if the inequality uses "<" or ">"; draw a filled in circle at each critical number if the inequality uses "$\displaystyle \leq$" or "$\displaystyle \geq$".

**Step 3:** Create a sign chart. The critical numbers partition the number line into regions. Choose a test value for each region, including one to the left of all the critical values and one to the right of all the critical values. For each test value, $\displaystyle v$, determine if $\displaystyle f(v)$ is positive or negative and record the result on the sign chart for each region.

**Step 4:** Use the sign chart to find the set of all values of $x$ for which the inequality is true. Write the answer in interval notation.

</Note>

---

# Example 24

<Example>

Solve $-3x^4 + 12x^3 - 9x^2 > 0$.

</Example>

---

# Rational inequality

<Note type="tip">

**Step 1:** Rewrite the inequality so there is a zero on the right side of the inequality. Write the expression on the left as a single algebraic fraction. Designate this fraction as $f(x)$.

**Step 2:** Find the critical numbers. For rational inequalities these critical numbers come from two sources.

$(a)$ Solve $f(x) = 0$. Find values that make the numerator of $f(x)$ zero.

$(b)$ Solve $f(x) =$ undefined. Find values that make the denominator of $f(x)$ zero. These critical points are where the vertical asymptotes are. These values are not part of the domain of $f(x)$. Therefore these critical values are never part of the solution set.

**Step 3:** Create a sign chart. The critical numbers partition the number line into regions. Choose a test value for each region. For each test value, $v$, determine if $f(v)$ is positive or negative and record the result on the sign chart for each region.

**Step 4:** Use the sign chart to find the set of all values of $x$ for which the inequality is true. Write the answer in interval notation.

</Note>

# Example 25

<Example>

Solve $\displaystyle \frac{1}{x^2 - 4} \leq \frac{1}{2 - x}$.

</Example>

# AM-GM inequality

<Theorem title="AM-GM inequality">

$$\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \geq \left(\prod_{i=1}^n x_i\right)^{1/n}$$

The equality holds if and only if $\displaystyle x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = x_n$ and they are positive numbers.

There are several ways to prove the AM-GM inequality. The most famous one is through induction by Cauchy.

</Theorem>

---

# Example 26

<Example>

Let $\displaystyle a_0 > a_1 > \ldots > a_n$ be real numbers. By rewriting $\displaystyle a_0 - a_n$ as $\displaystyle (a_0 - a_1) + (a_1 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_{n-1} - a_n)$, prove that

$$a_0 + \frac{1}{a_0 - a_1} + \frac{1}{a_1 - a_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{a_{n-1} - a_n} \geq a_n + 2n$$

</Example>

---

# Exercise 26

<ClassQuestion title="Exercise">

Let $\displaystyle a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ be positive real numbers such that $\displaystyle a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n = 1$. Show that

$$(1 + a_1)(1 + a_2) \cdots (1 + a_n) \geq 2^n$$

</ClassQuestion>

---

# Example 27

<Example>

What is the minimum of $\displaystyle \frac{4s^2 + 3t^2}{2st}$?

</Example>

# Rearrangement inequality

<Theorem title="Rearrangement inequality">

In mathematics, the rearrangement inequality states that

$$x_1 y_n + \cdots + x_n y_1 \leq x_1 y_{\sigma(1)} + \cdots + x_n y_{\sigma(n)} \leq x_1 y_1 + \cdots + x_n y_n$$

for every choice of real numbers

$$x_1 \leq \cdots \leq x_n \quad \text{and} \quad y_1 \leq \cdots \leq y_n$$

and every permutation $\displaystyle y_{\sigma(1)}, \ldots, y_{\sigma(n)}$ of $\displaystyle y_1, \ldots, y_n$

</Theorem>

---

# Proof

<Note type="tip">

Key observations:

- $\displaystyle a > b, c > d \Rightarrow (a - b)(c - d) > 0 \Rightarrow ac + bd > ad + bc$
- It suffices to prove the upper bound and apply to $\displaystyle -y_n \leq \cdots \leq -y_1$ to prove the lower bound
- Use proof by contradiction (suppose $\displaystyle c_n$ is paired with $\displaystyle b_m (m \neq n)$; $\displaystyle b_n$ is paired with $\displaystyle c_l (l \neq n)$ in the maximum case)
- Then use "induction"

</Note>

---

# Example 28

<Example>

Prove that

$$\frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{a + c} + \frac{c}{a + b} \geq \frac{3}{2}$$

for $\displaystyle a, b, c > 0$

A twice-differentiable function $\displaystyle g: I \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ is **concave** if and only if $\displaystyle g''(x) \leq 0$ for all $\displaystyle x \in I$.

# Jensen's inequality

<Theorem title="Jensen's inequality">

For $\displaystyle \left(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i = 1\right)$

If $\displaystyle f(x)$ is convex

$$f\left(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i\right) \leq \sum_{i=1}^n p_i f(x_i)$$

If $\displaystyle f(x)$ is concave

$$f\left(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i\right) \geq \sum_{i=1}^n p_i f(x_i)$$

</Theorem>

There are several ways to write the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

- $\displaystyle (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + \cdots + b_n^2) \geq (a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + \cdots + a_n b_n)^2$
- $\displaystyle \left|\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ y_1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} x_2 \\ y_2 \end{pmatrix}\right| \leq \left|\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ y_1 \end{pmatrix}\right| \left|\begin{pmatrix} x_2 \\ y_2 \end{pmatrix}\right|$
- T2 lemma: $\displaystyle \frac{\left(\sum_{i=1}^n u_i\right)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n v_i} \leq \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{u_i^2}{v_i}$

</Theorem>

# 3.2 数列与级数(Sequences and series)

# Sequence definition

<Definition title="Sequence">

In mathematics, a sequence is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed and order matters.

For example, (M, A, R, Y) is a sequence of letters with the letter 'M' first and 'Y' last. This sequence differs from (A, R, M, Y). Also, the sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), which contains the number 1 at two different positions, is a valid sequence. Sequences can be finite, as in these examples, or infinite, such as the sequence of all even positive integers $\displaystyle (2, 4, 6, \ldots)$.

The notations we often use are as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
a_1 &= \text{1st element of } (a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \\
a_2 &= \text{2nd element} \\
&\vdots \\
a_{n-1} &= \text{$(n-1)$th element} \\
a_n &= \text{$n$th element} \\
a_{n+1} &= \text{$(n+1)$th element}
\end{aligned}$$

</Definition>

# Recurrence relation

<Definition title="Recurrence relation">

Sequences whose elements are related to the previous elements in a straightforward way are often defined using recursion. This is in contrast to the definition of sequences of elements as functions of their positions.

To define a sequence by recursion, one needs a rule, called recurrence relation to construct each element in terms of the ones before it. In addition, enough initial elements must be provided so that all subsequent elements of the sequence can be computed by successive applications of the recurrence relation.

</Definition>

---

# Fibonacci sequence

<Example title="Fibonacci sequence">

The Fibonacci sequence is a simple classical example, defined by the recurrence relation

$$a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$$

with initial terms $\displaystyle a_0 = 0$ and $\displaystyle a_1 = 1$. From this, a simple computation shows that the first ten terms of this sequence are $\displaystyle 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21$, and $\displaystyle 34$.

A typical type of sequence question will be about finding the general solution ($\displaystyle a_n = f(n)$) from the recurrence relation.

</Example>

---

# Increasing/decreasing sequence

<Definition title="Increasing/decreasing sequence">

A sequence is **increasing** if $x_{n+1} \geq x_n$ for all $n$.

**Strictly increasing:** $x_{n+1} > x_n$ for all $n$.

A sequence is **decreasing** if $x_{n+1} \leq x_n$ for all $n$.

**Strictly decreasing:** $x_{n+1} < x_n$ for all $n$.

</Definition>

---

# Bounded/Unbounded

<Definition title="Bounded/Unbounded">

A sequence is **bounded** if there is a positive number $M$ such that $|x_n| \leq M$ for all $n$.

e.g. 

$$1, -1, 1, -1, \cdots$$

Otherwise, it is said to be **unbounded**.

e.g. 

$$1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \cdots$$

</Definition>

---

# Arithmetic progression

<Definition title="Arithmetic progression">

One of the most common sequences is the arithmetic progression/sequence.

The recurrence relation is given by

$$a_n = a_{n-1} + d, \quad n \geq 0, \quad d \text{ is a constant}$$

One can also show that

$$\begin{gathered}
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \\
S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)
\end{gathered}$$

Note: AP is not bounded if $d \neq 0$

</Definition>

---

# Geometric progression

<Definition title="Geometric progression">

Geometric Sequence: The recurrence relation is given by

$$a_n = r a_{n-1}, \quad n \geq 1, \quad r \text{ is a non-zero constant}$$

One can also show that

$$S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i = \frac{a_1(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}$$

As $n$ goes to infinity, if $|r| < 1, r \neq 0$

$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} S_n = \frac{a_1}{1 - r}$$

Note: GP is bounded if common ratio $|r| < 1, r \neq 0$.

</Definition>

# Example 33

<Example>

# Example 34

</Example>

$\{x_n\}$ satisfies $\displaystyle x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n^2 + 6}{5}$ and $x_0 > 3$.

Prove: $\{x_n\}$ is increasing

</ClassQuestion>

# Series definition

<Definition title="Series definition">

In modern terminology, any (ordered) infinite sequence $(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots)$ of terms (that is, numbers, functions, or anything that can be added) defines a series, which is the operation of adding the $a_i$ one after the other. To emphasize that there are an infinite number of terms, a series may be called an infinite series. Such a series is represented (or denoted) by an expression like

$$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots$$

or, using the summation sign,

$$\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} a_i$$

</Definition>

---

# Series definition (continued)

<Definition title="Series definition (continued)">

The infinite sequence of additions implied by a series cannot be effectively carried on (at least in a finite amount of time). However, if the set to which the terms and their finite sums belong has a notion of limit, it is sometimes possible to assign a value to a series, called the sum of the series. This value is the limit as $n$ tends to infinity (if the limit exists) of the finite sums of the $n$ first terms of the series, which are called the $n$th partial sums of the series. That is,

$$\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} a_i = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n a_i$$

When this limit exists, one says that the series is convergent, or that the sequence $(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots)$ is summable. In this case, the limit is called the sum of the series. Otherwise, the series is said to be divergent.

</Definition>

---

# Convergence

<Note type="tip">

To test whether a series is convergent, we often make comparison with common convergent series (sum of GP with a common ratio less than 1).

There are other tests available such as the integral test, the root test, or limit comparison test...

</Note>

---

# Example 36

<Example>

Prove that the harmonic series

$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \cdots$$

is divergent.

Prove also that the sum of reciprocals of primes also diverges

</Example>

---

# Sums of powers

<Remark type="remember">

The n-th partial sum of sequences of powers of natural numbers is quite common in MAT questions.

Some important results are as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
\sum_{k=1}^n k &= \frac{1}{2} n(n+1) \\
\sum_{k=1}^n k^2 &= \frac{1}{6} n(n+1)(2n+1) \\
\sum_{k=1}^n k^3 &= \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2
\end{aligned}$$

</Remark>

---

# Example 37

<Example>

Compute: $1^2 - 2^2 + 3^2 - \cdots - 99^2 + 100^2$

</Example>

---

# Method of differences

<Note type="tip">

The method of differences can be applied to find the sum of a series so long as the general term in the series can be expressed in the form $f(k+1) - f(k)$.

</Note>

---

# Example 38

<Example>

Find the infinite product $\displaystyle\prod_{n=2}^{\infty}\left(1 - \frac{1}{n^2}\right)$

</Example>

---

# Exercise 38

<ClassQuestion title="Exercise">

Use method of differences to find $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^n k^2, \quad \displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^n k^3, \quad \text{and} \quad \displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^n k^4$

</ClassQuestion>

# Example 39

<Example>

$(i)$ Find positive integers, $x_1$ and $y_1$, satisfying the equation $(x_1)^2 - 2(y_1)^2 = 1$

$(ii)$ Given integers $a, b$, we define two sequences $x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots$ and $y_1, y_2, y_3, \ldots$ by setting

$$x_{n+1} = 3x_n + 4y_n, \quad y_{n+1} = ax_n + by_n$$

for $n \geq 1$.

Find positive values for $a, b$ such that $(x_{n+1})^2 - 2(y_{n+1})^2 = (x_n)^2 - 2(y_n)^2$. Deduce that there are infinitely many pairs of integer solutions $x, y$ which solve the equation $x^2 - 2y^2 = 1$.

$(iii)$ Find a pair of integers $X, Y$ which satisfy $X^2 - 2Y^2 = 1$ such that $X > Y > 50$.

$(iv)$ Using the values of $a$ and $b$ found in part $(ii)$, what is the approximate value of $x_n / y_n$ as $n$ increases?
